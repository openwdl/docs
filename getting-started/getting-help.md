# Getting Help

The WDL community has a wide range of resources to help you when you need a helping
hand.

### Questions

As you're learning WDL, you're bound to have questions. We suggest the following
mechanisms for getting the answers you need.

- Search the [discussions](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/discussions) to see if your
  question has been asked already; if it hasn't been asked, feel free start a new
  discussion! If it's been asked but not yet answered, upvote the topic (if it's been
  some time, also feel free to chime in on the thread)!
- You may also join the community [Slack][slack-invite] and ask in the `#support`
  channel. We highly prefer that you come to the Slack channel with an issue that you
  can link us to, as responding to your issue helps us _more permanently_ answer the
  question for future askers.

### Bugs and new features

- Search the [issues](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/issues) to see if someone's already
  reported the issue. If your issue has _not_ already been reported, feel free to create
  a new one!
  - In particular, for feature requests, you are encouraged to start a discussion first
    at one of the places in the section above to get community buy-in before proceeding.
- If you'd like to provide a fix/implementation for an issue, please read about
  [contributing][contributing-md] before submitting a [pull
  request](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/pulls).

### Community resources

Last, we have a number of official resources to make sure you have materials to learn
from: be sure to check them out!

- The [official WDL documentation] (this site) is a great place to learn how to read and
  write WDL. All of the basic information you need to get started should be here! how to
  read and write WDL.
- If you're more of a guided learner, the [Learn WDL guide] walks you step-by-step
  through the basics writing and running WDLâ€”it even has an accompanying YouTube video!
- The [official WDL template repository] is a starter template for a best practice WDL workflow
  repository.
- Last, the [WDL specification] exhaustively documents the WDL standard.
