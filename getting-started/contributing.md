# Contributing

WDL is a community project and, thus, depends on _your_ contributions to make sure it
continues to thrive. Contributions can come in various forms, including:

- filing issues when you run into problems on GitHub,
- participating as part of language design discussions (via the [RFC process]),
- contributing language or code changes via [pull requests], and
- helping answer questions on [Slack][slack-invite].

Please browse the [OpenWDL organization] to learn about the different parts of the
project and get an idea of how you could contribute. Keep in mind that contributions to
WDL must be contributed according to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` ([link][contributing-md])
document.

### Suggested first steps

While all of these projects are important, consider starting with the [specification]
and [documentation] repositories. In particular keeping the documentation up to date is
importantâ€”things like typo fixes, updates to existing content, suggestions for new
documentation, and keeping the list of resources in the [Ecosystem](./ecosystem.md) page
is incredibly helpful!
